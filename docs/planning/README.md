# Planning
I want to do more of a fullscreen experience, it could start with a recreation of something like this:

![Pixel art splash screens and example assets](../assets/inspiration_pixelscreens.mp4)
###### (pairs good with the energy of 'Magdalena Bay - The Beginning'. Could split up the track into looping pieces + sound effects and use them respective to what part you're in i.e. the start of the song has a nice startup noise that could go into an analog hum noise - if i could find stems of the song that would help lots then i could create my own motifs toward the track)
